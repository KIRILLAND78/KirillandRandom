Small content pack. Developing this to just test my skills in programming. Nothing too exciting, but i am trying to make this mod as unique as possible.

Balancing might be a bit off.

Most weapons have their own gimmicks.
No wiki or something like that. Sorry. You have to figure everything on your own right now. But it is more fun that way, right?
